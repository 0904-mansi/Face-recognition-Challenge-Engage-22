# Face Recognition Challenge for Microsoft Engage'22 

## Problem Statementüßê 

Develop a browser-based application or a native mobile application to demonstrate application of Face Recognition technology.

## Solution

We all know that our Face is a unique and crucial part of the human body structure that identifies a person. Therefore, we can use it to trace the identity of a criminal person and also for finding missing people. With the advancement in technology, we are placed CCTV at many public places to capture the criminal‚Äôs crime. Using the previously captured faces and criminal‚Äôs images that are available in the police station, the criminal face recognition system of can be implemented. I propose an automatic criminal identification system and missing people identification for Police Department to enhance and upgrade the criminal distinguishing into a more effective and efficient approach. Technology working behind it will be face recognition, from the footage captured by the CCTV cameras; our system will detect the face and recognize the criminal who is coming to that public place. The captured images of the person coming to that public place get compared with the criminal data we have in our database. If any person‚Äôs face from public place matches, the system will display their image on the system screen and will give the message with their name that the criminal is found and present in this public place.
